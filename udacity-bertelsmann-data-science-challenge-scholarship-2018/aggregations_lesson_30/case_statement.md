Derive column take data from existing colimns and modify them.

"CASE" statement handles "if", "Then" logic, is follwed by at least one pair of "When" and "Then" statements. Must end with the world "END".

**CASE - Expert Tip**
+ The CASE statement always goes in the SELECT clause.

+ CASE must include the following components: WHEN, THEN, and END. ELSE is an optional component to catch cases that didnâ€™t meet any of the other previous CASE conditions.

+ You can make any conditional statement using any conditional operator (like WHERE) between WHEN and THEN. This includes stringing together multiple conditional statements using AND and OR.

+ You can include multiple WHEN statements, as well as an ELSE statement again, to deal with any unaddressed conditions.

Example
In a quiz question in the previous Basic SQL lesson, you saw this question:

Create a column that divides the standard_amt_usd by the standard_qty to find the unit price for standard paper for each order. Limit the results to the first 10 orders, and include the id and account_id fields. NOTE - you will be thrown an error with the correct solution to this question. This is for a division by zero. You will learn how to get a solution without an error to this query when you learn about CASE statements in a later section.

Let's see how we can use the CASE statement to get around this error.

```
SELECT id, account_id, standard_amt_usd/standard_qty AS unit_price
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;
```

Now, let's use a CASE statement. This way any time the standard_qty is zero, we will return 0, and otherwise we will return the unit_price.
```
SELECT account_id, CASE WHEN standard_qty = 0 OR standard_qty IS NULL THEN 0
                        ELSE standard_amt_usd/standard_qty END AS unit_price
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;
```

Example:
```
SELECT CASE WHEN total > 500 THEN 'Over 500'
	   ELSE '500 or under' END as total_group,
       COUNT(*) as order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1;
```

Using `WHERE` clause means only being able to get one set of data at a time.

```
SELECT COUNT(1) as oredrs_ver_500_units
FROM orders
WHERE total > 500;
```
