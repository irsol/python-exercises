# Frequency table.

The number of times a certain value appears in a row/set of data is called the **frequency**. Frequency is a better word for number.
For example, in the following list of numbers, the frequency of the number 3 is 6 (because it occurs 6 times):
  `1, 4, 3, 9, 11, 3, 3, 5, 77, 3, 88, 3, 3`

A frequency table is a simple way to display the number of occurrences of a particular value or characteristic.

A frequency distribution is a table showing each distinct value of some variable and the number of times it occurs in some dataset.

Frequency distribution helps us:
* to analyze the data
* to estimate the frequencies of the population on the basis of the ample
* to facilitate the computation of various statistical measures

A **relative frequency distribution**s is a distribution in which relative frequencies are recorded against each class interval.

# Tables.

Tables can show either **categorical variables** (sometimes called qualitative variables) or **quantitative variables** (sometimes called numeric variables). You 
can think of categorical variables as being categories (like eye color or brand of dog food) and quantitative variables as being numbers.
